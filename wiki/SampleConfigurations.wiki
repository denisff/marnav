#summary Installation use cases

= Sailboat =

 1. Airmar CS4500 (solid-state) temp / speed meter (output is NMEA 0183)
 1. Top-of-mast Airmar PB200 'weather station', giving output in both NMEA 0183 and NMEA 2000)
   1. 3-axis solid state compass gives heading and rate of turn
   1. 3-axis accelerometer
   1. Yaw rate gyro
   1. Internal WAAS GPS antenna gives position, COG, SOG, atomic clock time and satellite status
   1. True wind speed and direction
   1. Apparent wind speed and direction
   1. Pitch and roll
   1. Barometric pressure
   1. Air temperature
   1. Wind chill temperature

The speed meter compensates for currents, because the GPS can only give SOG.  The PB200 also wants a water speed input in order to calculate true wind.  This unit also updates at 2Hz, which makes timing for the start line that much better.
